## **Digital Design | NUS College of Design And Engineering**   
*Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA Board Project | Jan 2023 to May 2023*  
* Collaborated in a team of 4 to program a [Basys3 FPGA development board](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ygGjKbtW7wv7QLEer5ylAV-mJpV8W3-m/view?usp=drive_link) using Verilog, a hardware description language, successfully meeting both the given and open-ended project requirements  
* Applied knowledge of Number Systems, Boolean Logic, and Gate-Level Design to implement complex combinational logic and sequential logic circuits on the Basys3 FPGA development board      
* Executed testing and debugging procedures to ensure the robustness of the Verilog code, delivering a functional and error-free FPGA application  

## **Orbital | NUS School of Computing**   
*Independent Software Development Project | May 2022 to August 2022*  
* Developed a [mobile navigation application](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LctkmaBrIxnTpcVH-p-aYIDS_9tRh_dl/view?usp=drive_link) using JavaScript and React Native that helps visitors with the directions to their destinations within the School of Computing  
* Collaborated in a team of 2, ensuring project success through effective communication and coordination  
* Implemented Software Engineering Principles and Practices in the mobile navigation application  
* Level of Achievement: [Apollo 11](https://credentials.nus.edu.sg/1ac06b9f-4eb7-4ab2-8e88-52302402bbf5) (Advanced)  

## **Engineering Principles and Practice II | NUS College of Design And Engineering and School of Computing**   
*Complex Computer Engineering System Project | Jan 2022 to May 2022*  
* Collaborated in a team of 5 to design and develop a tele-operated robot with maze navigation capabilities  
* Operated the robot through remote control from a laptop, providing real-time environment mapping capabilities for the operator, and ensuring seamless communication between the master control program and the Arduino board.  
* Acquired proficiency in bare-metal programming and a wide range of topics such as Microcontroller Fundamentals, Robot Operating Systems, LIDAR technology, mapping algorithms, networking protocols, encryption methods, and odometry
