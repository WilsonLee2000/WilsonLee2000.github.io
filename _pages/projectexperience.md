## **Computer Engineering Capstone Project | NUS School of Computing**   
*System Integration and Development Capstone Project | Jan 2025 to May 2025*  
* Developed an immersive augmented reality-based game visualiser in Unity using C# and Vuforia, collaborating with 4 team members on hardware and systems integration to display real-time player statistics and game effects      
* Engineered interactive user interface components such as health bars, crosshairs, and ammunition counters for the visualiser, enabling dynamic responses to augmented reality markers and enhancing gameplay engagement    
* Resolved hardware-visualiser integration issues by prototyping multiple mounting configurations, ultimately improving stability and usability of the game visualiser  

## **Project Orbital | NUS School of Computing**   
*Independent Software Development Project | May 2022 to August 2022*  
* Collaborated in a team of 2 to build a (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LctkmaBrIxnTpcVH-p-aYIDS_9tRh_dl/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Mobile Navigation Application</a>) using JavaScript and React Native that provides users with updated information on venues in the School of Computing  
* Implemented software engineering principles and practices in the mobile navigation application, leading to a robust and scalable solution, and attained an advanced level of achievement for demonstrating strong performance and adherence to software engineering best practices  
* Level of Achievement: (<a href="https://credentials.nus.edu.sg/1ac06b9f-4eb7-4ab2-8e88-52302402bbf5" target="_blank">Apollo 11</a>) (Advanced)
