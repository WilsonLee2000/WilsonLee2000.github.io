### NUS School of Computing Orientation Group Leader | Freshmen Orientation Week | July 2022  
In July 2022, I had the opportunity of leading a group of freshmen during the School of Computing's Freshmen Orientation Week. We had a lot of fun and played games together. As their Orientation Group Leader, I wanted to help them feel at home in the School of Computing and get them excited about starting their university lives. It was awesome to see them make new friends and learn new things. I hope the memories and friendships they made through this orientation week will stick with them as they go through their 4 years in university!

### NUS School of Computing Orientation Group Leader | Freshmen Social Camp | June 2022
In June 2022, I had the privilege of serving as an Orientation Group Leader for a group of 13 enthusiastic freshmen during the School of Computing's Orientation Camp. Our time together was filled with laughter and team-building activities that brought us closer! As their Orientation Group Leader, I aimed to create a sense of belonging for them within the university and to make their orientation experience a memorable one. Witnessing their bonds deepen as they made new friends and embraced the orientation experience made me very happy. This serves as a reminder that what I have done for my freshmen, despite juggling multiple tasks during orientation such as their administrations, food, and safety, is undoubtedly worthwhile. I trust that the memories forged and connections established during this enriching orientation experience will remain steadfast as they navigate their transformative years ahead in the university!
