### NUS School of Computing Orientation Group Leader | Freshmen Orientation Week | July 2022  
In July 2022, I had the opportunity of leading a group of freshmen during the School of Computing's Freshmen Orientation Week. We had a lot of fun and played games together. As their Orientation Group Leader, I wanted to help them feel at home in the School of Computing and get them excited about starting their university lives. It was awesome to see them make new friends and learn new things. I hope the memories and friendships they made through this orientation week will stick with them as they go through their 4 years in university!

### NUS School of Computing Orientation Group Leader | Freshmen Social Camp | June 2022
In June 2022, I had the privilege of serving as an Orientation Group Leader for a group of 13 enthusiastic freshmen during the School of Computing's Orientation Camp. Our time together was filled with laughter and team-building activities that brought us closer! As their Orientation Group Leader, I aimed to create a sense of belonging for them within the university and to make their orientation experience a memorable one. Witnessing their bonds deepen as they made new friends and embraced the orientation experience made me very happy. 

This serves as a reminder that what I have done for my freshmen, despite juggling multiple tasks during orientation such as their administrations, food, and safety, is undoubtedly worthwhile. I trust that the memories forged and connections established during this enriching orientation experience will remain steadfast as they navigate their transformative years ahead in the university!

### National Youth Achievement Award Gold Award | Feb 2017 - Oct 2018
The National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) is one of the premier youth development programmes in Singapore. Officially launched on 9 May 1992 by the President of the Republic of Singapore at the Istana, the NYAA Programme aims to encourage young people between the ages of 13 and 30 years to develop personal qualities of self-reliance, perseverance and a sense of responsibility to themselves, to society and to the nation. 

From February 2017 to October 2018, I embarked on a transformative journey to fulfill the requirements of the NYAA Gold Award, a journey composed of five integral components. First, I embraced the challenge of an Adventurous Journey, immersing myself in a 4-day, 3-night adventure camp at Sembawang PAssion Wave. As a part of my commitment to Service, I dedicated four hours per week to volunteering at SHINE Children and Youth Services and Blangah Rise Primary School, where I tutored children with special needs and students from underprivileged families. 

Eager to make a difference, I initiated a Residential Project, organizing a heartwarming event that welcomed underprivileged families for a day of joyful family activities hosted at Anderson Junior College. My journey also included a culinary exploration as part of the Skills component and acquiring the fundamentals of basketball as part of the physical activity component. Each of these components, essential for earning the prestigious NYAA Gold Award, contributed not only to my personal growth but also to my development as a responsible and engaged leader of society.
