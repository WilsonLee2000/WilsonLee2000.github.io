### NUS School of Computing Orientation Group Leader | Freshmen Orientation Week | July 2022
* In July 2022, I had the opportunity of leading a group of freshmen during the School of Computing's Freshmen Orientation Week. We had a lot of fun and played games together. As their Orientation Group Leader, I wanted to help them feel at home in the School of Computing and get them excited about starting their university lives. It was awesome to see them make new friends and learn new things. I hope the memories and friendships they made through this orientation week will stick with them as they go through their 4 years in university!
