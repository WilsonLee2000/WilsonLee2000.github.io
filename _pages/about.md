I am a highly motivated and ambitious final-year undergraduate majoring in Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS). During my first two years at NUS, I participated in the University Town College Programme (UTCP) as a student of Tembusu College.

In my third year, I had the privilege of interning at a start-up within NUS Enterpriseâ€™s BLOCK71 incubator, where I developed key skills in entrepreneurship and innovation. Additionally, I am honoured to be part of the NUS Overseas College Entrepreneurship Development Programme in Munich, Germany, from February to July 2024.

My passion for Computer Engineering is complemented by a strong commitment to extracurricular activities. I have been actively involved in the NUS Muay Thai Club and the NUS Comedy Club, both of which have helped me develop a well-rounded university experience beyond academics.

I am also dedicated to technological innovation, having participated in several hackathons and ideathons during my undergraduate years. Currently, I am further honing my technical and collaborative skills as an Information Technology intern at Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Pizza Hut, contributing to various IT-related projects.

I am eager to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities in technology, entrepreneurship, and innovation. In my free time, I enjoy planespotting and working out at the gym.
