## Entrepreneurship Events:  
### Empowering Entrepreneurship: A Journey with RescaleLab’s A*StartCentral’s Essentials for Entrepreneurship Program  
From April to July 2023, I had the opportunity to take on the role of an intern Co-Lead Facilitator in RescaleLab's deep-tech startup journey within A*StartCentral's Essentials for Entrepreneurship Program. As an intern with RescaleLab, I had the incredible opportunity to support this transformative 20-week venture-building program, working alongside RescaleLab's founder, Gustavo Liu. He served as a lead instructor in this entrepreneurship program, along with a team of exceptional instructors including Mr. Harry Huo, Mr. Patrick Ng, Mr. Dennis Poh, and Mr. Sebastien Corominas. The completion of this transformative 20-week venture-building program marks not only the end of an intensive program but also the beginning of a new era of innovation and impact within the startup ecosystem. Looking ahead, I am excited about the future of RescaleLab and the continued pursuit of innovation and entrepreneurship.
