## Introduction 
"Why do I aspire to be an entrepreneur?" I asked myself when prompted to write this introduction. The world today is confronted with a multitude of problems, and not all of these issues can be solved by governments and large corporations alone.

The world today has a lot of problems!

Aspiring entrepreneurs like me aim to solve problems we dislike, are angry and upset about, to make the world a better place. As an entrepreneur wannabe, I'm drawn to the exciting uncertainty of the startup journey, where every day presents new obstacles to overcome and new opportunities to seize.

Being an entrepreneur is more than just taking risks and dreaming. It means turning things you genuinely care about into significant goals. It's about daring to change things and not giving up, even in challenging environments. Even though I'm not officially a startup founder, my aspirations to be an entrepreneur show that I want to change the world and disrupt the status quo. Every step of this journey teaches me that being an entrepreneur is both exciting and demanding, offering lessons from both successes and failures.

This section offers a glimpse into my world as an aspiring entrepreneur, where I share the milestones, insights, and experiences that shape my pursuit of entrepreneurial ventures. I invite you to join me on this exciting journey!  

## Entrepreneurship Experience  
### NUS Overseas Colleges: Munich, Germany
From February 2024 to July 2024, I participated in the NUS Overseas College (NOC) Entrepreneurship Development Programme.

My time with nextnano GmbH in Munich was a pivotal chapter in my entrepreneurial journey. As a Software and Business Intern, I played a key role in integrating the CRM system with leads and customers, automating email communications and follow-ups. I also leveraged CRM data to develop revenue forecasting scripts using Python and Jupyter Notebook, which were crucial for the company's strategic planning. This experience significantly enhanced my skills in business operations and strategic analysis.

Complementing this was the entrepreneurial prototyping course at the Technical University of Munich, which focused on applying prototyping methods to develop and validate new products and business models. The course equipped me with essential techniques for identifying customer problems, generating ideas, and iteratively testing solutions. The combination of hands-on experience and academic learning fostered a strong entrepreneurial mindset that I will carry forward.

Additionally, immersing myself in European culture and working in an international setting broadened my worldview and enriched my professional journey. My NOC experience has been truly unparalleled and formative!

### A*StartCentral's Talent Matching Programme 2023: Fostering Entrepreneurship and Collaboration Among Innovators  
From the 24th to the 25th of August 2023, the AStartCentral's Talent Matching Programme brought together a diverse group of entrepreneurs, founders, co-founders, researchers, and scientists from various industries, held at AStartCentral. I had the opportunity to manage this event as an intern co-lead facilitator. This unique initiative embraced a "speed-networking and dating" concept, enabling participants to introduce themselves, exchange ideas, and explore potential collaborations. The program's primary objective was to identify compatible co-founders and new partners, promoting entrepreneurship and innovation across industries. Much like the AStartCentral's Essentials for Entrepreneurship Programme experience, this event aimed to kindle the sparks of creativity and foster connections that drive the future of entrepreneurship and innovation. It served as a testament to the power of networking in nurturing new ideas and partnerships within the ever-evolving landscape of technology and entrepreneurship.
